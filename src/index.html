                <p>I've known Ray for a long time now, and I can say he was one of the best managers I've had. Ray leads
                  by example, he is a very hard worker and will try to get the best out of you, and even though he will
                  push you to be better, he is always kind and respectful. He will help you to set goals for your selves
                  and then help you achieve them.</p>
                <p>Ray is a good listener and creates an environment where you are not afraid to say what is on your
                  mind. Besides people skills, as an engineer, Ray is also excellent. Even though now is a manager, he
                  still has an engineer mind, and that helps a lot in the communication between engineers and product
                  managers.</p>
                <p>Working with Ray was one of the best work experiences I've had, and he will always have my respect
                  and admiration.</p>

                <p>I met Ray through Women @ Groupon Mentorship Program. As my mentor, Ray has been a great guide and
                  coach. Right from the beginning, he helped me keep my mentorship sessions structured and encouraged me
                  to drive them. During our discussions about career growth, he shared his goal-setting guide which I
                  found very useful in setting clear, actionable and time-bound career goals for myself. As our sessions
                  progressed, Ray encouraged me to come up with potential answers along with questions to discuss. This
                  helped me grow to solve problems on my own.</p>
                <p>Ray has an excellent work ethic. What really sets him apart as a great mentor is his ability to
                  empathize and relate to a problem. It has been a great experience learning from him</p>

                <p>I worked with Ray for 4 years at Groupon and he is one of the most well rounded individuals I've ever
                  seen. Not only is he a great Engineer/IC with excellent technical skills, he's also a great
                  communicator who can work in cross-functional roles to own and drive projects end to end.</p>
                <p>Over the years, he's worn many hats (Engineer, Product Manager, Data Analyst) and he's been exemplary
                  in all those different roles; and now as a people manager, he continues to do the same. He
                  successfully manages a team of 10 engineers at Groupon and did an excellent job focusing on not only
                  their work but also their personal development. He doesn't micromanage but instead does an excellent
                  job understanding the problem space and helps you brainstorm new ideas and creative solutions (all
                  backed up by his technical chops).</p>
                <p>Overall, Ray is an excellent individual to work with and anyone would be lucky to have him as their
                  manager.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Ray is the most generous human being, best manager, best colleague and the best mentor anyone can
                  have. I worked with him at Groupon for more than 4 years and have seen him in different roles (IC,
                  product manager, Engineering Manager, and Senior Engineering Manager)</p>
                <p>He is technically very sound and is the go-to person for everything. He will always have a solution
                  to every problem that you present to him. It was a very pleasant experience working with him. He used
                  to provide guidance and mentorship to junior engineers in the team and came up with tools and
                  processes that will save engineers time and help them be more productive.</p>
                <p>Whenever we used to work on time-sensitive projects and were short on time, he always used to come
                  with workarounds and solutions to unblock different teams and make progress to achieve different
                  milestones. He always had the long term vision and helped engineers to design and architect solutions
                  that would be scalable and extensible in the future. Ray always keep the interests of the company
                  before his personal interests and have always stepped up whenever the team needed any kind of help
                  from him. When we were short of Product managers and needed some help to bridge the gap between the
                  engineers and the PMs, he stepped up and filled in the shoes of a PM and helped the engineers to
                  understand new features from their perspective and bridge the gap. As he is technically sound, he
                  helped the other PMs by building different dashboards and also taught them how to use different tools
                  which would be useful for them.</p>
                <p>After a few months, the team needed some help to manage people in our team and Ray became the
                  engineering manager and I was one of the engineers reporting to him. He was a great manager and cared
                  about people's personal growth and interests a lot. Frontend engineers were given a chance to work on
                  backend and vice versa if they were interested. He helped engineers to ramp up on new projects or tech
                  stack and understood the required learning curve. He used to represent engineers in most of the
                  meetings where he could so that engineers are not wasting their time in meetings. He used to conduct
                  sprint planning meetings and helped in prioritizing different tasks keeping everyone's interest in
                  mind.</p>
                <p>Ray worked closely with other teams in the company and had a great relationship with them. Everyone
                  praised him to be technically strong and to deliver quality products on time. I have huge respect for
                  Ray and still consider him as my mentor who helps me make crucial career decisions. He will be a great
                  asset to any organization he works for and you will be extremely happy if you get a chance to work
                  with him :)</p>

                <p>As an engineering lead, he was a strong individual contributor that consistently delivered high
                  quality code and an amazing mentor that bettered everybody else. He taught us best practices and
                  devoted his personal time to build tools that greatly streamlined our processes. As an engineering
                  manager, he went above and beyond to develop personalized well-thought-out plans that significantly
                  helped me grow as an engineer and has continued to help me grow to this day.</p>

                  could plan things in advance, assign tasks to the suitable persons and prioritize the work very well.
                  You will not feel under big pressure when ramping up on new things since he is the go to person who

                  Although I did not work with him as an engineer before, he could understand the issues pretty quick

                  individual, he is extremely analytical. His decisions are based on a data backed intuition which
                  always helps the team stay grounded in truth - at the same time, he recognizes the benefit of
                  decisions made where no data supports them and enjoys learning from the results.</p>
                <p>Technically, Ray is amazing. I appreciate how he strives to maintain best practices on the database
                  side - which is extremely helpful to newcomers to the codebase as well as current members of the dev

                <p>He has an approachable personality and on many occasions, I noticed that less experienced developers

                <p>Ray is a quick learner, capable of swiftly and reliably learning new languages and technologies and
