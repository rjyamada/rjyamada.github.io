            <p>I'm an engineering leader, product manager, data analyst, developer, and entrepreneur. In the last decade, I've worked on various websites including FamilyFinds, CakeStyle, and Groupon. I leverage my startup and engineering experiences to drive projects from start to finish. </p>
            <p>Currently, I manage a handful of software engineers with experiences ranging from 1 to 8 years. I work closely with my team to plan and execute projects by being involved in technical discussions, architecture reviews, and sprint prioritization meetings. As a product manager, I strive to put consumers' interests first and rely on data to make critical decisions. I enjoy thinking of creative ways to collect data and build valuable features for our customers.</p>

                <p>Ray was the one of best engineers that I have ever worked with. He is able to pick up tasks very quickly, and what sets him apart from others is that he actively challenges engineers to put the right solution in place. Most importantly, on top of his intelligence, Ray is genuinely a good guy to be around both in and our of work.</p>
                <p>Ray is an All-Star engineer that I was very impressed with from his interview until the day I left Groupon. I genuinely hope that there comes an opportunity where we are able to work together again in the future.</p>

                <p>Ray was an amazing person to work with. Not only is he a really nice, responsible, focused individual, he is extremely analytical. His decisions are based on a data backed intuition which always helps the team stay grounded in truth - at the same time, he recognizes the benefit of decisions made where no data supports them and enjoys learning from the results.</p>
                <p>Technically, Ray is amazing. I appreciate how he strives to maintain best practices on the database side - which is extremely helpful to newcomers to the codebase as well as current members of the dev team. It doesn't stop there, he is equally amazing at writing good, reliable code.</p>
                <p>He has an approachable personality and on many occasions, I noticed that less experienced developers went to him for guidance on their projects.</p>
                <p>Ray was a tremendous asset to Cakestyle and Sandbox and I wouldn't hesitate to work with him again - I sincerely hope I get to.</p>

                <p>Ray is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, productive and pleasant engineer and team member. He is also loyal, reliable, fun and easygoing. It has been my pleasure to work with Ray for the past 18 months and I would recommend him highly.</p>
                <p>Ray is a quick learner, capable of swiftly and reliably learning new languages and technologies and adding them to his toolkit. He is adept across the full stack, and is eager and comfortable working on any type of project, from a front-end heavy initiative requiring jQuery, CSS and collaboration with designers, to an effort focused on optimizing database usage and enabling improved reporting functionality.</p>
                <p>Importantly, Ray combines his analytical mind and technical expertise with an ability to effectively interface with non-technical team members to solve problems, define project requirements, and think beyond specs to understand business implications and help identify issues before they arise. Ray offers a great balance of challenging/questioning with a collaborative and problem-solving orientation.</p>

                <p>Working with Ray at FamilyFinds was a a great experience all around. Not only is he skilled at all things technical, but he also has a way of explaining things to non-tech people that is always clear and effective. We worked closely together on a couple of pivot ideas for FamilyFinds and I consistently founds Ray's questions, comments and ideas smart and helpful. I will consider myself lucky if our professional paths cross again one day.</p>

                <p>Ray is sharp, talented, HIGHLY motivated developer with a thirst for doing things right and making a difference in the lives of those using the products he builds. He came to work with me at FamilyFinds, just a couple of weeks after graduating from USC with his Computer Science masters and I have to say, in the six months we've worked together, Ray has become an absolutely essential part of the engineering team here. He writes clean code that works and isn't afraid to dive into any part of our architecture. Email marketing, reporting, content management systems, e-commerce checkout -- Ray has worked on it all. He's an excellent communicator who we rely on to interact directly with our partners / clients as well as other team members internally, with little or no management supervision. Above all, his attitude strikes an ideal balance between enthusiasm and high standards. Because of that, he has thrived in the fast-paced, e-commerce environment at FamilyFinds and I only wish we could have worked together longer.</p>
