                <p>I've known Ray for a long time now, and I can say he was one of the best managers I've had. Ray leads by example, he is a very hard worker and will try to get the best out of you, and even though he will push you to be better, he is always kind and respectful. He will help you to set goals for your selves and then help you achieve them.</p>
                <p>Ray is a good listener and creates an environment where you are not afraid to say what is on your mind. Besides people skills, as an engineer, Ray is also excellent. Even though now is a manager, he still has an engineer mind, and that helps a lot in the communication between engineers and product managers.</p>
                <p>Working with Ray was one of the best work experiences I've had, and he will always have my respect and admiration.</p>

                <p>I met Ray through Women @ Groupon Mentorship Program. As my mentor, Ray has been a great guide and coach. Right from the beginning, he helped me keep my mentorship sessions structured and encouraged me to drive them. During our discussions about career growth, he shared his goal-setting guide which I found very useful in setting clear, actionable and time-bound career goals for myself. As our sessions progressed, Ray encouraged me to come up with potential answers along with questions to discuss. This helped me grow to solve problems on my own.</p>
                <p>Ray has an excellent work ethic. What really sets him apart as a great mentor is his ability to empathize and relate to a problem. It has been a great experience learning from him</p>

                <p>I worked with Ray for 4 years at Groupon and he is one of the most well rounded individuals I've ever seen. Not only is he a great Engineer/IC with excellent technical skills, he's also a great communicator who can work in cross-functional roles to own and drive projects end to end.</p>
                <p>Over the years, he's worn many hats (Engineer, Product Manager, Data Analyst) and he's been exemplary in all those different roles; and now as a people manager, he continues to do the same. He successfully manages a team of 10 engineers at Groupon and did an excellent job focusing on not only their work but also their personal development. He doesn't micromanage but instead does an excellent job understanding the problem space and helps you brainstorm new ideas and creative solutions (all backed up by his technical chops).</p>
                <p>Overall, Ray is an excellent individual to work with and anyone would be lucky to have him as their manager.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Ray is the most generous human being, best manager, best colleague and the best mentor anyone can have. I worked with him at Groupon for more than 4 years and have seen him in different roles (IC, product manager, Engineering Manager, and Senior Engineering Manager)</p>
                <p>He is technically very sound and is the go-to person for everything. He will always have a solution to every problem that you present to him. It was a very pleasant experience working with him. He used to provide guidance and mentorship to junior engineers in the team and came up with tools and processes that will save engineers time and help them be more productive.</p>
                <p>Whenever we used to work on time-sensitive projects and were short on time, he always used to come with workarounds and solutions to unblock different teams and make progress to achieve different milestones. He always had the long term vision and helped engineers to design and architect solutions that would be scalable and extensible in the future.  Ray always keep the interests of the company before his personal interests and have always stepped up whenever the team needed any kind of help from him. When we were short of Product managers and needed some help to bridge the gap between the engineers and the PMs, he stepped up and filled in the shoes of a PM and helped the engineers to understand new features from their perspective and bridge the gap. As he is technically sound, he helped the other PMs by building different dashboards and also taught them how to use different tools which would be useful for them.</p>
                <p>After a few months, the team needed some help to manage people in our team and Ray became the engineering manager and I was one of the engineers reporting to him. He was a great manager and cared about people's personal growth and interests a lot. Frontend engineers were given a chance to work on backend and vice versa if they were interested. He helped engineers to ramp up on new projects or tech stack and understood the required learning curve. He used to represent engineers in most of the meetings where he could so that engineers are not wasting their time in meetings. He used to conduct sprint planning meetings and helped in prioritizing different tasks keeping everyone's interest in mind.</p>
                <p>Ray worked closely with other teams in the company and had a great relationship with them. Everyone praised him to be technically strong and to deliver quality products on time.  I have huge respect for Ray and still consider him as my mentor who helps me make crucial career decisions. He will be a great asset to any organization he works for and you will be extremely happy if you get a chance to work with him :)</p>

                <p>Ray commands respect by simply being the perfect colleague. I've had the pleasure of working with him during my time as a software engineer at Groupon.</p>
                <p>As an engineering lead, he was a strong individual contributor that consistently delivered high quality code and an amazing mentor that bettered everybody else. He taught us best practices and devoted his personal time to build tools that greatly streamlined our processes. As an engineering manager, he went above and beyond to develop personalized well-thought-out plans that significantly helped me grow as an engineer and has continued to help me grow to this day.</p>
                <p>Ray is both the best engineering lead and engineering manager I've had. Any organization/cause would be extremely fortunate to have him.</p>

                <p>It is a wonderful experience working with Ray and the GoodsCX team for the past two years!</p>
                <p>As a manager, Ray has a super comprehensive understand what happens in the team all the time. He could plan things in advance, assign tasks to the suitable persons and prioritize the work very well. You will not feel under big pressure when ramping up on new things since he is the go to person who will help you find the resource which is needed and understand your pain points and try his best to help you overcome the difficulties and get the job done. Ray also cares about people's growth. He will listen to your needs, your goals, and try to find the related works which match with your interested area.</p>
                <p>As an engineer, I think Ray has strong knowledge and skills on both frontend and backend areas. Although I did not work with him as an engineer before, he could understand the issues pretty quick and give good recommendations and advice during the stands and meetings.</p>

He is able to pick up tasks very quickly, and what sets him apart from others is that he actively challenges engineers to put the right solution in place. Most importantly, on top of his intelligence, Ray is genuinely a good guy to be around both in and our of work.</p>
                <p>Ray is an All-Star engineer that I was very impressed with from his interview until the day I left Groupon. I genuinely hope that there comes an opportunity where we are able to work together again in the future.</p>

                <p>Ray was an amazing person to work with. Not only is he a really nice, responsible, focused individual, he is extremely analytical. His decisions are based on a data backed intuition which always helps the team stay grounded in truth - at the same time, he recognizes the benefit of decisions made where no data supports them and enjoys learning from the results.</p>
                <p>Technically, Ray is amazing. I appreciate how he strives to maintain best practices on the database side - which is extremely helpful to newcomers to the codebase as well as current members of the dev team. It doesn't stop there, he is equally amazing at writing good, reliable code.</p>
                <p>He has an approachable personality and on many occasions, I noticed that less experienced developers went to him for guidance on their projects.</p>
                <p>Ray was a tremendous asset to Cakestyle and Sandbox and I wouldn't hesitate to work with him again - I sincerely hope I get to.</p>

                <p>Ray is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, productive and pleasant engineer and team member. He is also loyal, reliable, fun and easygoing. It has been my pleasure to work with Ray for the past 18 months and I would recommend him highly.</p>
                <p>Ray is a quick learner, capable of swiftly and reliably learning new languages and technologies and adding them to his toolkit. He is adept across the full stack, and is eager and comfortable working on any type of project, from a front-end heavy initiative requiring jQuery, CSS and collaboration with designers, to an effort focused on optimizing database usage and enabling improved reporting functionality.</p>
                <p>Importantly, Ray combines his analytical mind and technical expertise with an ability to effectively interface with non-technical team members to solve problems, define project requirements, and think beyond specs to understand business implications and help identify issues before they arise. Ray offers a great balance of challenging/questioning with a collaborative and problem-solving orientation.</p>

                <p>Working with Ray at FamilyFinds was a a great experience all around. Not only is he skilled at all things technical, but he also has a way of explaining things to non-tech people that is always clear and effective. We worked closely together on a couple of pivot ideas for FamilyFinds and I consistently founds Ray's questions, comments and ideas smart and helpful. I will consider myself lucky if our professional paths cross again one day.</p>

                <p>Ray is sharp, talented, HIGHLY motivated developer with a thirst for doing things right and making a difference in the lives of those using the products he builds. He came to work with me at FamilyFinds, just a couple of weeks after graduating from USC with his Computer Science masters and I have to say, in the six months we've worked together, Ray has become an absolutely essential part of the engineering team here. He writes clean code that works and isn't afraid to dive into any part of our architecture. Email marketing, reporting, content management systems, e-commerce checkout -- Ray has worked on it all. He's an excellent communicator who we rely on to interact directly with our partners / clients as well as other team members internally, with little or no management supervision. Above all, his attitude strikes an ideal balance between enthusiasm and high standards. Because of that, he has thrived in the fast-paced, e-commerce environment at FamilyFinds and I only wish we could have worked together longer.</p>
